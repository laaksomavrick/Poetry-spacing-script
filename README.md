# Poetry-spacing-script
This is a one-off script I've made to dynamically space poems on a line by line basis with a distribution like a sin curve. 

For example:
```
I have met them at close of day
Coming with vivid faces
From counter or desk among grey   
Eighteenth-century houses.
I have passed with a nod of the head   
Or polite meaningless words,   
Or have lingered awhile and said
Polite meaningless words,
And thought before I had done
Of a mocking tale or a gibe
To please a companion
Around the fire at the club,   
Being certain that they and I
But lived where motley is worn
```
Becomes:

```
         I have met them at close of day
            Coming with vivid faces
               From counter or desk among grey   
            Eighteenth-century houses.
         I have passed with a nod of the head   
      Or polite meaningless words,   
   Or have lingered awhile and said
   Polite meaningless words,
      And thought before I had done
         Of a mocking tale or a gibe
            To please a companion
               Around the fire at the club,   
            Being certain that they and I
         But lived where motley is worn
